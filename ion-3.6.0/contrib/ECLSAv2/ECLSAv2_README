The software contained in this directory consists of the components necessary
to build a fully functional ECLSA (Errror Correcting Lin Service Adapter, a
link server adapter mainly intended to be used under the Licklider Transmission
Protocol (LTP), in ION (Interplanetary Overlay Network), the DTN package
written by NASA-JPL.  https://sourceforge.net/projects/ion-dtn/

ECLSAv2 is inspired by (if is not a compliant implementation of) what is
described in the informative document CCSDS 131.5-O-1 Orange Book, Sept. 2014
ERASURE CORRECTING CODES FOR USE IN NEAR-EARTH AND DEEP-SPACE COMMUNICATIONS.
