ionsecrc \- ION security policy management commands file
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\s-1ION\s0 security policy management commands are passed to \fBionsecadmin\fR either
in a file of text lines or interactively at \fBionsecadmin\fR's command prompt
(:).  Commands are interpreted line-by line, with exactly one command per
line.  The formats and effects of the \s-1ION\s0 security policy management commands
are described below.
.PP
A parameter identifed as an \fIeid_expr\fR is an \*(L"endpoint \s-1ID\s0 expression.\*(R"  For
all commands, whenever the last character of an endpoint \s-1ID\s0 expression is
the wild-card character '*', an applicable endpoint \s-1ID \s0\*(L"matches\*(R" this \s-1EID\s0
expression if all characters of the endpoint \s-1ID\s0 expression prior to the last
one are equal to the corresponding characters of that endpoint \s-1ID. \s0 Otherwise
an applicable endpoint \s-1ID \s0\*(L"matches\*(R" the \s-1EID\s0 expression only when all characters
of the \s-1EID\s0 and \s-1EID\s0 expression are identical.
.PP
\&\s-1ION\s0's security policy management encompasses both \s-1BP\s0 security and \s-1LTP\s0
authentication.  \s-1ION\s0 has begun supporting the proposed \*(L"streamlined\*(R" Bundle
Security Protocol (Internet Draft draft\-birrane\-dtn\-sbsp\-00) in place of
standard Bundle Security Protocol (\s-1RFC 6257\s0).  Since \s-1SBSP\s0 is not yet a
published \s-1RFC, ION\s0's Bundle Protocol security mechanisms will not necessarily
interoperate with those of other \s-1BP\s0 implementations.  This is unfortunate but
(we hope) temporary, as \s-1SBSP\s0 represents a major improvement in bundle security.
It is possible that the \s-1SBSP\s0 specification will change somewhat between now
and the time \s-1SBSP\s0 is published as an \s-1RFC,\s0 and \s-1ION\s0 will be revised as necessary
to conform to those changes, but in the meantime we believe that the advantages
of \s-1SBSP\s0 make it more suitable than \s-1RFC 6257\s0 as a foundation for the
development and deployment of secure \s-1DTN\s0 applications.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.IX Header "COMMANDS"
.IP "\fB?\fR" 4
.IX Item "?"
The \fBhelp\fR command.  This will display a listing of the commands and their
formats.  It is the same as the \fBh\fR command.
.IP "\fB#\fR" 4
.IX Item "#"
Comment line.  Lines beginning with \fB#\fR are not interpreted.
.IP "\fBe\fR { 1 | 0 }" 4
.IX Item "e { 1 | 0 }"
Echo control.  Setting echo to 1 causes all output printed by ionsecadmin to
be logged as well as sent to stdout.  Setting echo to 0 disables this behavior.
.IP "\fBv\fR" 4
.IX Item "v"
Version number.  Prints out the version of \s-1ION\s0 currently installed.  \s-1HINT:\s0
combine with \fBe 1\fR command to log the version number at startup.
.IP "\fB1\fR" 4
.IX Item "1"
The \fBinitialize\fR command.  Until this command is executed, the local \s-1ION\s0
node has no security policy database and most \fIionsecadmin\fR commands will fail.
.IP "\fBa key\fR \fIkey_name\fR \fIfile_name\fR" 4
.IX Item "a key key_name file_name"
The \fBadd key\fR command.  This command adds a named key value to the
security policy database.  The content of \fIfile_name\fR is taken as the
value of the key.  Named keys can be referenced by other elements of the
security policy database.
.IP "\fBc key\fR \fIkey_name\fR \fIfile_name\fR" 4
.IX Item "c key key_name file_name"
The \fBchange key\fR command.  This command changes the value of the named
key, obtaining the new key value from the content of \fIfile_name\fR.
.IP "\fBd key\fR \fIkey_name\fR" 4
.IX Item "d key key_name"
The \fBdelete key\fR command.  This command deletes the key identified by \fIname\fR.
.IP "\fBi key\fR \fIkey_name\fR" 4
.IX Item "i key key_name"
This command will print information about the named key, i.e., the length of
its current value.
.IP "\fBl key\fR" 4
.IX Item "l key"
This command lists all keys in the security policy database.
.IP "\fBa bspbabrule\fR \fIsender_eid_expr\fR \fIreceiver_eid_expr\fR \fI{ '' | ciphersuite_name key_name }\fR" 4
.IX Item "a bspbabrule sender_eid_expr receiver_eid_expr { '' | ciphersuite_name key_name }"
The \fBadd bspbabrule\fR command.  This command adds a rule specifying the
manner in which Bundle Authentication Block (\s-1BAB\s0) validation will be applied
to all bundles sent from any node whose endpoints' IDs match
\&\fIsender_eid_expr\fR and received at any node whose endpoints' IDs
match \fIreceiver_eid_expr\fR.  Both \fIsender_eid_expr\fR and \fIreceiver_eid_expr\fR
should terminate in wild-card characters, because both the security source
and security destination of a \s-1BAB\s0 are actually nodes rather than individual
endpoints.
.Sp
If a zero-length string ('') is indicated instead of a \fIciphersuite_name\fR then
\&\s-1BAB\s0 validation is disabled for this sender/receiver \s-1EID\s0 expression pair: all
bundles sent from nodes with matching administrative endpoint IDs to nodes
with matching administrative endpoint IDs will be immediately deemed authentic.
Otherwise, a bundle from a node with matching administrative endpoint \s-1ID\s0 to a
node with matching administrative endpoint \s-1ID\s0 will only be deemed authentic
if it contains a \s-1BAB\s0 computed via the ciphersuite named by \fIciphersuite_name\fR
using a key value that is identical to the current value of the key named
\&\fIkey_name\fR in the local security policy database.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1NOTE\s0\fR: if the security policy database contains no \s-1BAB\s0 rules at all, then
\&\s-1BAB\s0 authentication is disabled; all bundles received from all neighboring
nodes are considered authentic.  Otherwise, \s-1BAB\s0 rules \fBmust\fR be defined
for all nodes from which bundles are to be received; all bundles received
from any node for which no \s-1BAB\s0 rule is defined are considered inauthentic
and are discarded.

.IX Item "c bspbabrule sender_eid_expr receiver_eid_expr { '' | ciphersuite_name key_name }"
The \fBchange bspbabrule\fR command.  This command changes the ciphersuite
name and/or key name for the \s-1BAB\s0 rule pertaining to the sender/receiver \s-1EID\s0
expression pair identified by \fIsender_eid_expr\fR and \fIreceiver_eid_expr\fR.
Note that the \fIeid_expr\fRs must exactly match those of the rule that is to
be modified, including any terminating wild-card character.
.IP "\fBd bspbabrule\fR \fIsender_eid_expr\fR \fIreceiver_eid_expr\fR" 4
.IX Item "d bspbabrule sender_eid_expr receiver_eid_expr"
The \fBdelete bspbabrule\fR command.  This command deletes the \s-1BAB\s0 rule
pertaining to the sender/receiver \s-1EID\s0 expression pair identified by
\&\fIsender_eid_expr\fR and \fIreceiver_eid_expr\fR.  Note that the \fIeid_expr\fRs
must exactly match those of the rule that is to be deleted, including any
terminating wild-card character.
.IP "\fBi bspbabrule\fR \fIsender_eid_expr\fR \fIreceiver_eid_expr\fR" 4
.IX Item "i bspbabrule sender_eid_expr receiver_eid_expr"
This command will print information (the ciphersuite and key names) about the
\&\s-1BAB\s0 rule pertaining to \fIsender_eid_expr\fR and \fIreceiver_eid_expr\fR.
.IP "\fBl bspbabrule\fR" 4
.IX Item "l bspbabrule"
This command lists all \s-1BAB\s0 rules in the security policy database.

.IX Item "a bspbibrule source_eid_expr destination_eid_expr block_type_number { '' | ciphersuite_name key_name }"
The \fBadd bspbibrule\fR command.  This command adds a rule specifying the
manner in which Block Integrity Block (\s-1BIB\s0) validation will be applied
to blocks of type \fIblock_type_number\fR for all bundles sourced at any node
whose administrative endpoint \s-1ID\s0 matches \fIsource_eid_expr\fR and destined for
any node whose administrative endpoint \s-1ID ID\s0 matches \fIdestination_eid_expr\fR.
.Sp
If a zero-length string ('') is indicated instead of a \fIciphersuite_name\fR
then \s-1BIB\s0 validation is disabled for this source/destination \s-1EID\s0 expression
pair: blocks of the type indicated by \fIblock_type_number\fR in all
bundles sourced at nodes with matching administrative endpoint IDs and
destined for nodes with matching administrative endpoint IDs will be
immediately deemed valid.  Otherwise, a block of the indicated type that
is attached to a bundle sourced at a node with matching administrative
endpoint \s-1ID\s0 and destined for a node with matching administrative endpoint
\&\s-1ID\s0 will only be deemed valid if the bundle contains a corresponding \s-1BIB\s0
computed via the ciphersuite named by \fIciphersuite_name\fR using a key
value that is identical to the current value of the key named \fIkey_name\fR
in the local security policy database.

.IX Item "a bspbcbrule source_eid_expr destination_eid_expr block_type_number { '' | ciphersuite_name key_name }"
The \fBadd bspbcbrule\fR command.  This command adds a rule specifying the
manner in which Block Confidentiality Block (\s-1BCB\s0) encryption will be applied
to blocks of type \fIblock_type_number\fR for all bundles sourced at any node
whose administrative endpoint \s-1ID\s0 matches \fIsource_eid_expr\fR and destined for
any node whose administrative endpoint \s-1ID ID\s0 matches \fIdestination_eid_expr\fR.
.Sp
If a zero-length string ('') is indicated instead of a \fIciphersuite_name\fR
then \s-1BCB\s0 encryption is disabled for this source/destination \s-1EID\s0 expression
pair: blocks of the type indicated by \fIblock_type_number\fR in all
bundles sourced at nodes with matching administrative endpoint IDs and
destined for nodes with matching administrative endpoint IDs will be
sent in plain text.  Otherwise, a block of the indicated type that
is attached to a bundle sourced at a node with matching administrative
endpoint \s-1ID\s0 and destined for a node with matching administrative endpoint
\&\s-1ID\s0 can only be deemed decrypted if the bundle contains a corresponding \s-1BCB\s0

.IX Item "x [ { ~ | sender_eid_expr } [ { ~ | receiver_eid_expr} [ { ~ | bab | pib | pcb | esb } ] ] ]"
This command will clear all rules for the indicated type of bundle security
block between the indicated security source and security destination.  If
block type is omitted it defaults to \fB~\fR signifying \*(L"all \s-1BSP\s0 blocks\*(R".  If
both block type and security destination are omitted, security destination
defaults to \fB~\fR signifying \*(L"all \s-1BSP\s0 security destinations\*(R".  If all three
command-line parameters are omitted, then security source defaults to \fB~\fR
signifying \*(L"all \s-1BSP\s0 security sources\*(R".
